# Limited Pixel Attack BraTS
- An extremely limited scenario where the attacker can only perturb a certain number of pixels in the image.
- Semi-black box attack : requires only the probability labels.
- Differential Evolution is used to compute the locations and values of the pixels to be perturbed.

## Objectives
- Determine the effectiveness of limited pixel attacks on brain MRI classification tasks.
- Parallelise differential evolution to make the experiment less computationally taxing.
